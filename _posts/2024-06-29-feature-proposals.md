It would be good to update this format so only the headings are animated.

This would make each sentence be emphasized less. 

But it also means that it'd be easier to get through shorter, more structured
documents.

Here are some features that would be neat to have.

1. Pressing spacebar or the arrow keys should advance the document, too.

2. The home page should look *much* nicer (maybe include some images?)

3. Ensure mobile works

4. Make lists work

5. Make entire screen clickable (increase container size)
