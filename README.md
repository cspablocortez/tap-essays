the form of an iPhone app.

(16:48) Turn this into a Jekyll site to leverage markdown -> HTML conversion.

```sh
$ bundle init
```

(16:50) Edit the `Gemfile` in a text editor and add jekyll as a dependency.

```sh
gem "jekyll"
```

(16:52) Run `bundle` to install jekyll.

```sh
$ bundle
```

(16:56) Update CSS to prevent text from being selected:

```css
.container p {
    display: none;
    text-align: center;
    font-size: 1.5rem;
    user-select: none;
}
```

# File Structure

(17:00) 

Create these Jekyll-specific folders: `_layouts`, `_posts`, `_includes`.

```sh
$ mkdir _layouts _posts _includes
```

## Step 1

Create default HTML template. Copy the contents of `index.html` into `default.html`.

`$ touch _layouts/default.html`

Next, replace the placeholder paragraph elements with the Liquid content tag: `{{ content }}`. Donâ€™t forget the front matter lines at the top of the file.

## Step 2

Update `index.html` file to be a simple markdown file with plain text content, all HTML info will have been moved to the `default.html`.

## Step 3

We will define three new layouts:

- default (static content)
- tapped (one paragraph at a time)
- typed (automatically typed content)

To do this, first we will move the content within the `<script>` over to the `tapped.html`. We will also have to update our CSS to produce a readable document.
